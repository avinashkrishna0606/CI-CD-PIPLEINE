# CI-CD-PIPLEINE
here is an example of a CI-CD pipeline for a sample application using Jenkins with a code build and a docker build step:
1.Install and set up Jenkins on your server or local machine.
2.Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.
3.Configure the pipeline to pull your source code from your version control system (e.g. Git) and set up the build triggers (e.g. build on push to main branch).
4.Set up the build step to compile and test your code using a build tool such as Maven or Gradle.
5.Add a Dockerfile to your project, specifying how to build the Docker image for your application.
6.Configure the docker build step to build a Docker image of your application, using the Dockerfile you created in step 5.
7.Publish the Docker image to a container registry such as Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or Google Container Registry.
8.Optionally, configure the pipeline to deploy the Docker image to your production environment.

# CODE
in the code, there is an example of Jenkinsfile that implements the above steps:
